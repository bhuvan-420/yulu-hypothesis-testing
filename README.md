# Yulu Hypothesis Testing Project

This project applies hypothesis testing to understand factors affecting the demand for Yulu’s shared electric bikes in India.

## 📌 Objectives
- Identify significant variables influencing rental demand.
- Perform:
  - 2-Sample T-Test (Working vs Non-working days)
  - ANOVA (Season-wise and Weather-wise demand)
  - Chi-square Test (Season vs Weather dependency)

## 🧪 Statistical Concepts Used
- Bi-variate analysis
- T-test, ANOVA, Chi-square
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual Analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 📁 Contents
- yulu.docx: Full analysis and statistical tests

## 🔧 Tools
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy)
- CSV data file: bike_sharing.csv

## 📈 Key Insights
- Rentals vary significantly by *season* and *weather*
- Working days show *higher average usage*
- Weather is *dependent on season* (statistically)
